                    <h2>The story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. Onze excuses. We kunnen je verzoek op dit moment niet verwerken. Probeer het later opnieuw.
                        That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. 
                        They said, <blockquote class='quote'>“We are so sorry to hear your horse 
                        has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</blockquote>   
                        The farmer said, <b><blockquote class='quote'>“Maybe.”</blockquote></b> 
                        The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses 
                        with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, 
                        <blockquote class='quote'>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. 
                        You now have eight horses!”</blockquote> The farmer again said, 
                        <b><blockquote class='quote'>“Maybe.”</blockquote></b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, 
                        and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. 
                        The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too <span class='bad'>bad</span>,” 
                        and the farmer responded, <b><blockquote class='quote'>“Maybe.”</blockquote></b>                        The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people 
                        into the army, and they rejected his son because 
                        he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and 
                        said, <blockquote class='quote'>“Isn’t that great!”</blockquote> Again, he said, <b><blockquote class='quote'>“Maybe.”</blockquote></b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of 
                        immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether 
                        anything that happens in it is <span class='good'>good</span> or <span class='bad'>bad</span> — because you never 
                        know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, 
                        you never know what will be the consequences of <span class='good'>good</span> fortune.

                            <span class='good'>Good</span> and <span class='bad'>Bad</span> are just one perspective. 
                            Bananas are <span class='good'>good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class='good'>good</span>
                             for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
